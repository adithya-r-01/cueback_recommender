# CueBack Recommender

A project built on top of Java frameworks utilizing User-Based collabarative filtering techniques. This project specifically utilizes Manhattan Distance to create efficient recommendations.

## Requirements
 
This project is built with Java and utilizes Apache Maven. Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information (the pom.xml file). This provides the same functionality as using packages. Much like when using the ArrayList structure in Java you don't necessarily need to provide the source code.

The java version that I am using:

```bash
openjdk version "15.0.2" 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 15.0.2+7-27)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.2+7-27, mixed mode, sharing)
```

The maven build that I am using:

```bash
Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /Users/adithya/Downloads/apache-maven-3.6.3
Java version: 15.0.2, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-15.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.16", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

Additionally, it would be beneficial to use intellij as the IDE to open this project's source code as it has the best support for maven projects.
